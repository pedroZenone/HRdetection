# Heart Rate Detection

This was my first data science project. Without knowing what was DS (I started this on 2014 aprox) my journey started here, applying wavelet transform to the electrocardiography signal so as to detect the QRS complex (basically the heartbeat) it was like "building a good ruler".

In brief, if you can detect a heart pump, you can measure the distance between pumping that is measure the hearte rate. With this you can predict many kind of arrhythmias, for more datails you can see the attached paper that has exposed at a bioengineering journal. The most suitable wavelet was the one which gave high accuarcy
